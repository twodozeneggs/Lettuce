# Lettuce
A quiz app developed for Lettuce Entertain You's 2022 Coding Challenge. 

App developed using React Native and tested with Expo. 

Features to be added in the coming days:
  - Try again button on the Results page, getting you back to the home screen to try a new combination of answers.
  - Form Validation, the app really wants to know what show you'd binge on a snowy day!
  - Picutres of the soup that correspond with the Restaurant output, because everybody needs more soup pictures. 
  - Status Bar indicating how far along you are in the quiz
  
  Thank you Beth for your time and this opportunity; I hope you have a wonderful holiday season!
  
  All the best,  
  Simon
